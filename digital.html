						<p><b>Assignment:</b> Make a semiotic image depicting a rude behavior.</p>
						<p><b>Outcome:</b> I chose to depict the act of eavesdropping. <br>
							I aimed for a minimalistic type of illustration by using only black and white, and incorporating silhouettes. The the two types of characters were illustrated to look as if they were created with two different styles, reflecting the difference between their amount of knowledge and really highlighting the intruder.</p>

						<p><b>Assignment:</b> Take a chapter from the book "Invisible Cities" by Italo Calvino and illustrate what the city would look like.</p>
						<p><b>Outcome:</b> I chose the city Valdrada from the chapter "Cities & Eyes" <em>(excerpt <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~cinichol/CreativeWriting/323/CalvinoInvisibleCities.htm" target="_blank">here</a>).</em> Valdrada is a city split into two: one upright and one inverted. I saw it as a city obsessed with image, and with what is constructed rather than real.<br></br>
						What I chose to do is illustrate how the residents of this city would see themselves: never as a whole, but always as exaggerated, inaccurate parts.</p>

						<p><b>Assignment:</b> Take two songs and illustrate what these sounds would look like.</p>
						<p><b>Outcome:</b> The two songs chosen were Dave Brubeck's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs" target="_blank">Take Five</a> and Explosion in the Sky's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKyrULAfvq8" target="_blank">Your Hand in Mine</a>. <br> The first creation is a direct opposition between Take Five's cooler, smooth jazzy tones and Your Hand in Mine's chaotic build up coupled with a constant background beat.</p>

Staccatos are paired with long, smoother melodies as represented by the variation in shape and thickness. </p>

					<div class="cn-content">
						<p><b>Assignment:</b> Create a 30 second GIF with a twist</p>
						<p><b>Idea:</b> After trying out a few storyboards, I arrived at the idea of an arcade toy claw machine. It would feature a little boy playing the machine and trying to grab a teddy bear. He would try three times: first missing entirely, second dropping the bear and third, finally winning. The <em><b>twist</b></em> is that upon winning, a claw comes down and grabs him, and the role of the bear and boy reverse.</p>

						<div id="over"><img src="images/dig/anniefinalanimation.gif" alt="Be patient..." /></div>
						<p> The final GIF animation: 77 frames total</p>
						<p> The animation was made in Photoshop using Timeline. Each frame was made by gradually editing movement through moving pieces of the previous frame, redrawing and recoloring. The time between each frame was adjusted to make it move smoothly and to add dramatic effect to certain scenes. </p>

						<p><b>Assignment:</b> Collect data on something about yourself then design a pattern from that data. Finally, create an article of clothing using that design.</p>
						<p> I'm a big snoozer so I decided to track the amount of alarms I needed to wake up, the amount of sleep I got in terms of sleep cycles and how important it was to wake up on time that day. <br></br>
						The design was made in Processing and Illustrator. I based it off of what a sleep cycle would look like for a certain amount of hours slept. The number of different colored dots represented the number of alarms I needed to wake up (clearly quite a lot), and the border color represented importance (warmer colors being more important). <br>
						The wearable I decided to create was a night dress. I put my data on the skirt portion of that dress shown here.</p>

						<p> <b>Skirt:</b> I had to use origami folding techniques to make the skirt have pleats and be easy to put on and fit. It had a total of 16 folds.</p>
						<p> <b>Top:</b> The top half of the dress was to be made of origami fans, that would be attached to side parts and a belt. The design was made in Illustrator and reflected a night time scene to match the context of the dress.</p>

						<p> The final product, taken for an End of the Year Salon.</p>
						<p>The top and skirt portions were both attached to a hard surface paper belt with added-on velcro, making it adjustable to the waist. The top was attached by tying string and the skirt by attaching stick-shape hard surface paper pieces at intervals to accomodate the skirt's folding shape. Tissue paper was used as decoration and to support the top part.</p>
